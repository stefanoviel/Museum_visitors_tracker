# Managing flow of visitors in a museum

This is my highschool thesis in electronics at ITIS Galileo Galilei Conegliano. 
In this project I have used a PIC16f887 to regulate the flow of visitors in a museum. The following features are implemented: 

* counting of visitors and block of the entrance in case the maximum capacity is exceeded
* display of the current number of visitors inside the musuem on a LCD display (comunication through I2C protocol)
* recognition of guard pass card 
* activation of allarm if the maximum number of visitor is exceeded
