# Managing flow of visitors in a museum

In this project I have used a PIC16f887 to regulate the flow of visitors in a museum. The following features are implemented: 

* counting of visitors and block of the entrace 
* display of the number of visitors on a LCD display (comunication through I2C protocol)
* recognition of guard pass card 
* activation of allarm
